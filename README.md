# Project Overview

Developing the user interface for the setup procedure for the Furhat mental health coach to make it suitable for children/teenagers.
- simple UI, not a lot of text, mostly pictures, easy for children to use
- Tech Stack: React

# Research

- **Using [Gestalt](https://uxplanet.org/using-gestalt-laws-of-perceptual-organization-in-ui-design-77d4eb8201f9) Laws of Perceptual Organization in UI Design**
    - Gestalt - ‘shape’ or ‘form’
    1. law of similarity
    2. law of symmetry - grouping similarly and symmetry creates stability and order
    3. law of common regions - border to separate
    4. figure grounds - models → the focus
    5. law of proximity - groupings
    6. law of continuity
    7. law of closure - close the shapes
    8. common fate principle

- [designing for children](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/08/designing-web-interfaces-for-kids/) learnings:
    - sound is important
    - touch can be used to initiate the mouse-over functionality
    - use large, visually distinct hotspots.
    - no hotspots near the edges of the screen
    - no scroll
    - **More images, less text**
    - **Provide instant feedback**

# What is next
- User Research
    1. Informal Design Workshops with Groups of Children: Engage in playful interactions to gather data and insights.
    2. Formal Research Study: Develop an ethical application, design a comprehensive methodology, conduct the study, and produce a research paper based on the findings.
- Integration with Furhat Robot: Customize the Furhat Robot based on user selections by connecting to it and sending the final JSON configuration.
